# Turing Pi 2 Setup

A repository documenting my experience and also TODOs for future setups of Turing Pi 2 cluster.

## Docs

- [Hardware](./docs/hardware.md)
- [Setup](./docs/setup.md)

## Moving forward

I want to install a Kubernetes (k3s) cluster onto the board and run a few services on that.

If you are interested in the Kubernetes setup, etc. See [vojtechmares/tpi2-cluster1](https://github.com/vojtechmares/tpi2-cluster1).
